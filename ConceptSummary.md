# Concept Summary #

## Spring framework ##
Spring framework can be thought of as a smart contractor for your Java application. It
does the heavy lifting of managing the complex infrastructure concerns that would
otherwise be overwhelming. Technically, we can say Spring is a lightweight and
extensible framework that acts as a container handling the creation, configuration, and
lifecycle of Java objects, usually referred to as beans, enabling you to overcome tight
coupling using Dependency Injection (DI).  
This helps developers focus on core business logic.

## Inversion of Control (IoC) ##
Usually, when class implementations overlap or are related in a way, they end up being
tightly coupled, where the creation of one requires that it also be created during the
same instance. However, an IoC container provides a way to create, configure,
manage, and control the entire lifecycle of objects (beans). Using Dependency Injection,
the Spring container ( IoC)  manages the instantiation, configuration and use of the
object based on input and design.
## REST ##
REST mean Representational State Transfer, which has to do with how the state of
objects and data is maintained. This includes their creation, retrieval, update and
deletion, a common term known as CRUD. REST follows certain principles that lead to
the development of a RESTful API that allows for inter-application communication when
managing resource objects. Some of the principles are HTTP standards that allow for
the transfer and storage of data between applications.
